# Uniform

Our policy is that all children should wear clothing that is in keeping with a purposeful learning ethos. We also believe that certain school activities are facilitated by specialised and appropriate clothing (including organised events outside normal school hours).

Our school uniform will:

* promote a sense of pride in the school;
* engender a feeling of belonging;
* be practical and support the safety of children in our leaning environments;
* identify children with the school;
* not distract in class (as fashion clothing might be);
* make children feel equal to one another in terms of appearance; reflect the sense both of community and of diversity that the school takes pride in;
* be regarded as suitable, and good value for money, by most parents.
