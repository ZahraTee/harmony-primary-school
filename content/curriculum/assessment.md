# Assessment

###### The National Curriculum has been written to give Age Related Expectations (ARE) for the end of each year. As children travel from Year 1 to Year 6 in our school, they are tracked against the Age Related Expectations. At Harmony Primary School we use RM Integris to support our tracking, this provides us with numbered bands and steps to track children.

###### The school reports to parents three times a year, at parents evenings you will receive your child's targets based on the RM Integris curriculum linked statements. Parents often find it useful to view all the statements and you can find them and answers to frequently asked questions below.
