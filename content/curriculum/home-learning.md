# Home-Learning

Homework, is known as, 'Home-Learning' at Harmony Primary School, it is an integral part of the learning process at HPS. Home-Learning builds on school based learning and improves pupil academic achievement. Homework is an essential aspect of becoming a confident and independent learner, which will help throughout their time at school and beyond.

Pupils are expected to record homework tasks in their School diary during every lesson. Home-Learning is set according to a weekly timetable homework. The amount of time pupils should spend on home-learning increases as they move up the year group.
