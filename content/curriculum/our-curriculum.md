# Curriculum

### Intent

At Harmony Primary School, we strive to ensure that all children are educated through a broad and balanced curriculum: one that promotes their emotional, social, physical and intellectual needs. We provide a stimulating and inviting learning environment where all children’s interests and learning preferences are fostered using a range of resources and pedagogic techniques to meet the needs of an ambitious curriculum. At HPS, we wish for all our children to feel safe and secure in their environment; developing and building upon their self-confidence, independence and eagerness to learn new skills. We aim to work in partnership with parents, carers and families; thereby promoting child-centred support to facilitate their individual learning journeys.

### Implementation

At Harmony Primary School, we endeavour to establish an effective teaching and learning environment based on The National Curriculum, carefully supplemented by a range of extra-curricular learning opportunities to help support our students in a comprehensive manner.

We adopt a thematic approach to teaching that highlights the links between and across National Curriculum subjects. We feel that this pedagogic method is fundamental to the development of a well-rounded and inquisitive young learner. Every Harmony Primary School pupil is thereby supported to achieve their fullest potential, by acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to help them develop into kind and conscientious contributors to society.

### Impact

We want our learners to become rounded characters with a clear understanding of complex values like fairness, friendship, trust and many others. From this they will develop a character, grounded in Islamic principles and commonly shared British values, that prepares them for living in the community demonstrating tolerance and equality. We measure this not just by the work our children produce, but in the behaviours we see each and every day in all learners on the playground, in corridors, and in the many roles we give them.

Our learners are guided by all staff on how to approach challenges every day. This could be on the playground, in a game or disagreement, or in class in a complex learning challenge. The impact should be that children don’t give up, are highly empowered to succeed, achieve at a high standard and are independent and nurturing.
