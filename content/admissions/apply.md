# Apply

To apply for a place for your child at Harmony Primary School, please complete our enrolment form.

{{% file-download "Enrolment Form" "./HPS_Pupil_Application_Form.pdf" %}}

Our applications process includes an Entry Test for all children from year 1 to Year 6. If the child is able to successfully complete this assessment set by the school, then an informal interview with your child and the parents will be arranged with a view to offering a place within our school.

Please note that places at Harmony Primary School are limited by small class sizes and early applications are strongly encouraged.
