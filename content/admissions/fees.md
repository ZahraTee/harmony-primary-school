# Fees

Harmony Primary School is a fee paying school. The Fee Schedule will be updated annually and uploaded here, interested parents are invited to check back for the updated Fees Schedule.

On occasion, the school may make an additional charge for additional activities e.g. trips and visits, which are compulsory to attend for students, but these will always be shared with parents in advance. When such activities are organised they will be introduced compulsorily as part of the school's curriculum experience. A limited number of specialist resources, e.g. Y6 exam revision aids or resources e.g. Arabic language, Art materials, etc. may also be required to be purchased by parents, these remain with students, and the costs for such items will be limited but necessary and **must** be purchased at the request of the school, normally at the beginning of the academic year or during the first term. Additional charges are made for uniforms (compulsory) on an individual basis with further information and costs available via the 'Uniform' section of this site.
