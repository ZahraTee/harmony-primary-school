# Our Core Values

## Community

We will seek to foster strong links with the wider community and encourage our children to appreciate differences in age, ethnicity and social background. Harmony Primary School will place the pupil at the heart of the community and we intend for the outstanding education that our children receive to become a source of nourishment for the wider community.

## Excellence

We will motivate pupils and teachers to strive for high levels of excellence in all their endeavours, whether academic or skills based. We will nurture an environment where excellence is demanded from students and teachers alike as we maintain our curricular focus upon core educational skills.

## Discipline

At Harmony Primary School, discipline will be linked to achievement and this element of our ethos is therefore closely tied to our curricular commitments. We will strive to instil a positive work-ethic in all our pupils.

## Achievement

This reflects our commitment to providing an outstanding academic curriculum that is broad and balanced with equal opportunities for every pupil. We believe our progressive educational methodology will enable pupils to aim high and reach even higher in an environment that nurtures their wellbeing, achievement, and creativity.

## Respect

We will cultivate respectful attitudes between pupils, teachers, parents, carers and the wider community. We are dedicated to promoting a safe environment where pupils can thrive as individuals while understanding their responsibilities to the wider school community. Our attention to encouraging social consciousness will link to the commitments we make in our extended curriculum.
