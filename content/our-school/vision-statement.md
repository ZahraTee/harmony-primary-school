# Vision Statement

## An excellent education rooted in Islam.

### Our Mission
At Harmony Primary School our children lay down strong academic roots as they enjoy a rich and balanced curriculum that nurtures their abilities. It is our mission to bring out the best in each individual striving for excellence on a daily basis. We work together with parents, professionals and educators to cultivate an inspiring learning experience in an Islamic environment.

### About Us
Harmony Primary School is an association of Parents, Professionals and Educationalists working together to return the benefits of our experience in the UK to the communities we grew up in. With a passion for core Islamic Values and a desire to empower the next generation we set about establishing an inspiring new school preparing our children for life in Modern Britain.
