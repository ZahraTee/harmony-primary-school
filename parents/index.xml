      <description>Uniform Our policy is that all children should wear clothing that is in keeping with a purposeful learning ethos. We also believe that certain school activities are facilitated by specialised and appropriate clothing (including organised events outside normal school hours).
Our school uniform will:
 promote a sense of pride in the school; engender a feeling of belonging; be practical and support the safety of children in our leaning environments; identify children with the school; not distract in class (as fashion clothing might be); make children feel equal to one another in terms of appearance; reflect the sense both of community and of diversity that the school takes pride in; be regarded as suitable, and good value for money, by most parents.</description>
