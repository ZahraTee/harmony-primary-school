				<h1 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h1>
<h3 id="intent">Intent</h3>
<p>At Harmony Primary School we strive to ensure that all children are given a curriculum which is relevant broad and balanced, promoting their emotional, social, physical and intellectual needs. We create a stimulating and inviting learning environment where all children’s interests and learning are fostered using a range of sources to meet the needs of the curriculum. At HPS we wish for all our children to feel safe and secure in their environment, developing self-confidence, independence, self-esteem and an eagerness to learn. We aim to work in partnership with parents, carers and families, promoting the very best relationship to support learning.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>At Harmony Primary School we are aware that children’s learning needs to keep pace with our rapidly changing world. Our creative curriculum is a carefully planned, thematic approach to teaching and learning designed to support children’s natural curiosity, stimulate their creativity and reflects the pupils` cultural capital. It offers children the opportunity to work in depth, giving them the time they need to reflect, consolidate and transfer their learning across subjects. There is a strong emphasis on not only building up the knowledge, understanding and skills within each topic but also why the chosen learning programme is important to the here and now.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>We want our learners to become rounded characters with a clear understanding of complex values like equality, friendship, trust and many others. From this they will develop a character, grounded in Islamic principles and guided by British values, that prepares them for living in the community demonstrating tolerance and equality. We measure this not just by the work our children produce, but in the behaviours we see each and every day in all learners on the playground, in corridors, and in the many roles we give them.</p>
<p>Our learners are guided by all staff on how to approach challenges every day. This could be on the playground, in a game or disagreement, or in class in a complex learning challenge. The impact should be that children don’t give up, are highly empowered to succeed, achieve at a high standard and are independent and nurturing.</p>
