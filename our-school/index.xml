      <description>Proprietor&amp;rsquo;s Ambitions Growing up in West London I have been privileged to have had access to great education throughout my youth. Seeing the benefit that a holistic and aspirational education can bring to one&amp;rsquo;s life. Over the past few years I have connected with other like-minded professionals and together we have set upon working to return the benefits of our experience to the very communities in which we were raised. With a shared a passion for education, we have found great rewards in the nurturing and development of the younger generation and thus embarked upon supporting, developing and nurturing our youth to be aspirational and forward looking young people with a strong sense of identity and belief in themselves as proud British Muslims.</description>
