    Harmony Primary School Prospectus
</a>
<h3 id="our-ethos">Our Ethos</h3>
<p>Harmony Primary School is an Islamic faith school which follows the Sunni methodology. Our Islamic Curriculum is based upon the Ash^ari and Maturidi theology and promotes the four schools of thought, namely the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi^iy and Hanbali madhabs. As a school, we commemorate Islamic occasions such as RamaDaan, ^Eid, Israa' and Mi^raaj and the Birth of Prophet Muhammed sallallaahu ^alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<h1 id="our-core-values">Our Core Values</h1>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>We will seek to foster strong links within the wider community and we actively encourage our children to celebrate commonality and appreciate difference. Harmony Primary School places the pupil at the heart of the community through a wide variety of outreach programmes and through links with local schools and community groups.</p>
<h2 id="excellence">Excellence</h2>
<p>We motivate pupils and teachers to strive for excellence in all their endeavours; both academic and extra-curricular. Through setting high expectations for learning and supporting the learners with a range of activities in our after-school club programme, we aim to offer a holistic approach to personal success.</p>
<h2 id="discipline">Discipline</h2>
<p>At Harmony Primary School, discipline is closely linked to our reward and sanction system. This element of our ethos is one that relies on a strong relationship between parents and teachers to maintain a sense of consistency for the young learners. We strive to instil a good work ethic in all our pupils through a transparent behaviour policy and through positive reinforcement.</p>
<h2 id="achievement">Achievement</h2>
<p>Our commitment to providing an outstanding academic curriculum that is broad and balanced, with equal opportunities for every pupil, is a core part of our ethos. Our progressive educational methodology enables pupils to aim high in an environment that nurtures their wellbeing and development.</p>
<h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>
<p>We cultivate respectful attitudes between pupils, teachers, parents, carers and within the wider community. We are dedicated to promoting a safe environment where pupils can thrive as individuals while understanding their responsibilities to the wider school community. Our emphasis in encouraging social consciousness links to the commitments we have made through both timetabled subjects and our extra-curricular programme.</p>
