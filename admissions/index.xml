      <description>Apply The formal applications process will commence upon successful registration with the DfE. However, parents are encouraged to complete the Expression of Interest form in the first instance.
Once the school is operational our applications process will include an Entry Test for all children from year 1 to Year 6, if the child is able to successfully complete this assessment set by the school, then an informal interview with your child and the parents will be arranged with a view to offering a place within our school.</description>

      <description>Expression of Interest Parents are asked to complete an application form to express their interest for entry to Harmony Primary School and, based upon this information, we will commence the applications process once the school has achieved DfE (Department for Education) registration.
